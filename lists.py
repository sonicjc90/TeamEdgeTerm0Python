 #  Use this program to learn about Python lists:
    
 #  1. Declare and store data in lists
 #  2. Access list data by index
 #  3. Modify list data by index
 #  4. Multi-dimensional lists (lists inside lists!)
 #  5. List methods: append() and pop()
 #  6. The length of the list - introduce conditionals
 #  7. Strings as sequences - join() split() 
 #  
 #  Follow the -->To Dos ! run the program to test often and debug

#Lists have properties. one of the most important is the size, or length. Here are two examples:
print(f"I have {len(names)} friends")

#Strings can also be thought of lists:
sentence = "I am a boring sentence."

print("boring sentence as a list: " + str(boring_list))

word = "Abracadabra"
word_split_list = word.split() #split by nothing, and you get each character in the string as its own element.
print("letter by letter: " + str(word_split_list))

#using this you can split strings up by any character!

#-->TODO: Change the name of the person who is late in this sentence and print it.
split_me = "I heard Alex was late to class today."

#-->TODO: Add an exclamation mark to this sentence using split() and append(), then print. (yes, there are other ways, but...)
make_me_exciting = "What a wonderful day"

#We can also join our list elements into a string using.....join()!
rejoined = " ".join(boring_list)  #joins it using spaces
print('back in one piece: ' + rejoined)

#-->TODO:  Finally, put the split_me sentence today and the make_me_exciting strings back together and print. You should see a string
